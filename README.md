# Regions Of Europe
Europe is traditionally divided into several regions: **Western Europe**, known for its economic powerhouses like France and Germany; **Eastern Europe**, with countries such as Poland and Russia, shaped by a rich, complex history and post-Soviet transitions; **Southern Europe**, which includes Mediterranean countries like Italy, Spain, and Greece, known for their warm climate and ancient civilizations; **Northern Europe**, featuring the Nordic countries and Baltic states, recognized for their high standards of living and environmental consciousness; and **Central Europe**, a culturally diverse region including Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic, marked by historical empires and modern-day economic integration. Each region contributes uniquely to the continent's cultural, political, and geographical landscape.
